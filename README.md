## Stakeholders

#### Interview: Alison Evans, School Founder

**Goals and Needs:**<br/>

- Stay on track and achieve goals
- Become more aware of behaviors to change or stop
- Use an app that:
  - Has clear directions
  - Is easy to use
  - Includes:
    - Widgets
    - Customizable notifications
    - Interactive elements (e.g., games)
    - Charts to visualize progress
    - Ability to share information with friends
    - Smartwatch integration
- Stay motivated through:
  - Internal decision-making (needs to find something important)
  - Visual progress and identifying patterns
  - Words of encouragement
- Have a "one-stop shop" for tracking multiple habits, instead of using different apps for:
  - Water intake
  - Weight
  - Exercise
  - Standing
  - Sleep
- Keep tracking engaging with:
  - Achievements
  - Option to watch an ad to revive a lost streak

**Problems and Frustrations:**<br/>

- Apps that are not user-friendly
- Excessive reminders when missing a habit
- High costs of habit-tracking apps
- Losing motivation when running out of achievements
- Finds Appleâ€™s built-in tracking tools boring
- Dislikes losing streaks in tracking apps
- Has tried to-do lists but gave up on them
- Would not use a notes or reflections feature

#### Interview: Anna Li, Finance Student

**Goals and Needs:**<br/>

- Checkboxes
- Headings & colour coding to group assignments/subjects
- Calendar & list view
- Can use emojis

**Problems and Frustrations:**<br/>

- Not much organization in notes app - all lists are in one note and it gets long
- In a planner I don't like when there are prompts to fill in
- Boring
- Not enough space or too much space given to fill things in

#### Interview: Raphael Huang, Student and Teaching Assistant

**Goals and Needs:**<br/>

- Easy to check and check off habits, especially when lazy
  - As few gestures as possible between app opening and habit checking / checking off
- More likely to use if customizable, looks good
- Ability to track both once a day habits (i.g. making bed in the morning) and multiple times per day habits (i.g. brushing teeth)
- Visualization of consistency/ ability to view data on consistency of habit
- Customizable frequency for habits (once a week, every day, every tues/thurs, etc)
- Able to see what is 'up next' for the day, what habits still need to be completed

**Problems and Frustrations:**<br/>

- Don't want to have to rewrite habits every night
- Doesn't want ways to 'cheat' habit system
- Doesn't want to spend more than a few minutes on the app per day
  - Bloat like notes or social features not only not helpful, but not welcome
- Allowing for 'one time habits' (grocery lists, etc) would clog up the app, make them less likely to use

#### Interview: Tanya Thakkar, Dental Student

**Goals and Needs:**<br/>

- Wants to keep track water intake and how much she exercises
- Need to feel a sense of accomplishment by checking/crossing something off
- Wants to be held accountable by seeing how long she has kept a habit for
- Wants to be rewarded for having a long streak

**Problems and Frustrations**<br/>

- Never found a habit tracker she has liked, so she has never tried
- Does not like when apps are boring/not easy to use
